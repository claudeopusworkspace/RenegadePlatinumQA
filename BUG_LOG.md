### BUG-003: `auto_grind` cancels Chimchar→Monferno evolution and leaves dialogue hanging

- **Tool**: `auto_grind`
- **Severity**: major (misses an evolution, and the residual dialogue jams subsequent tool calls)
- **Save state**: `bug_auto_grind_evolution_stop_lingering_dialogue` (captures the stuck "Huh? Chimchar stopped evolving!" dialogue on the top screen; player on Route 202 grass at (163,805); Chimchar is Lv14 with Flame Wheel already learned, i.e. move-learn flow *did* complete before the evolution step went wrong)
- **Call sequence**:
  1. `auto_grind(move_index=2, backup_move=0, target_level=15, auto_heal=True)` from (163,806). After 7 wild battles returned `stop_reason: "move_learn"` — Chimchar wants to learn Flame Wheel.
  2. `auto_grind(move_index=2, backup_move=0, target_level=15, auto_heal=True, forget_move=1)` to replace Leer → returned `stop_reason: "seek_failed"` / `stop_detail: "seek_encounter returned 'blocked'"` with 0 battles fought.
- **Expected**: After the move-learn resolution, Chimchar should (a) learn Flame Wheel, (b) run through the Chimchar→Monferno evolution cutscene (auto-advanced by the tool per CLAUDE.md: *"Evolution is handled — after level-up + move-learn resolution, battle_turn detects 'is evolving' text and handles it automatically. Works in both battle_turn and auto_grind flows."*), and (c) continue grinding toward Lv15.
- **Actual**: Flame Wheel was learned, but the evolution sequence was **canceled** (the "Huh? Chimchar stopped evolving!" dialogue is on screen and `read_party` reports Chimchar still species 390 at Lv14). The second `auto_grind` call saw the lingering dialogue and bailed with `seek_failed`. Manual recovery required pressing B, then A, then ~120 frames to clear the overlay and return to overworld.
- **Workaround**: Manually dismiss the "stopped evolving" dialogue with `press_buttons(["b"])` + `press_buttons(["a"])`, then re-call `auto_grind`. Evolution is missed entirely — Chimchar will try again on next level-up per vanilla rules.
- **Notes**: The advertised auto-evolution handler looks like it pressed B (or otherwise declined) instead of letting the evolution finish. Combined cost: (1) a missed/delayed evolution, and (2) a zombie dialogue that breaks the next tool call. Might be specific to the mid-battle/post-level-up evolution path — worth checking whether the issue is an overzealous B-mash in the move-learn confirmation sequence that bleeds into the evolution prompt.

### BUG-002: `auto_grind` auto-heal stops on wild-battle FAINT_SWITCH prompt

- **Tool**: `auto_grind`
- **Severity**: major (breaks the auto-heal loop)
- **Save state**: `bug_auto_grind_faint_switch_stuck` (captures the stuck state: wild Rattata on field, "Choose a Pokémon" switch prompt on bottom screen, Shinx fainted with 3 other party members alive)
- **Call**: `auto_grind(move_index=0, target_level=11, auto_heal=True)` with Shinx Lv5 (11/19 HP) as slot 0 on Route 202. Other party members full HP.
- **Expected**: When slot 0 faints in a wild encounter, auto-heal should either (a) flee the battle and navigate to the nearest PC, or (b) switch to another party member and continue grinding. The tool advertises "when heal_x/heal_y/grind_x/grind_y are set … auto-heals on faint or PP depletion" and `auto_heal=True` should do the equivalent.
- **Actual**: Stopped immediately after the first Rattata battle with `stop_reason: "heal_failed"` and `stop_detail: "Failed to exit battle after faint. State: WAIT_FOR_ACTION"`. `heal_trips: 1` — so the tool tried to heal but gave up. Game is still in the battle at the **FAINT_SWITCH** prompt (bottom screen shows "Choose a Pokémon." with Shinx marked FNT). The reported state `WAIT_FOR_ACTION` doesn't match what's actually on screen — looks like the tool polled once and timed out instead of recognizing FAINT_SWITCH.
- **Workaround**: Manually call `battle_turn(switch_to=N)` to send another Pokemon, or `battle_turn(run=True)` to flee, then `heal_party` from overworld.
- **Notes**: Misidentification of the prompt state is probably the root cause — if the tool expected a regular action prompt after faint instead of a FAINT_SWITCH, the subsequent flee/switch logic never fires. Seems specific to **wild battles** where the player can flee, since the earlier Barry trainer-battle faint sequence returned the correct `FAINT_FORCED`/`BATTLE_ENDED` flow.

### BUG-001: `throw_ball` formatted output reports `State: TIMEOUT` after successful catch

- **Tool**: `throw_ball`
- **Severity**: minor (cosmetic)
- **Save state**: `bug_throw_ball_state_mismatch` (state is *after* the bug; the successful catch is already reflected in party slot 3)
- **Call**: `throw_ball()` against a Lv5 Shinx at 11/19 HP after Burmy's Tackle — 5th ball, caught successfully.
- **Expected**: `formatted` string should end with `State: CAUGHT` to match the JSON field `final_state: "CAUGHT"`.
- **Actual**: JSON correctly reports `"final_state":"CAUGHT"` and Shinx is in party slot 3 with full data, *but* the `formatted` human-readable log ends with `State: TIMEOUT`. The two are contradictory. Also in the same `formatted` string, the "Gotcha! Shinx was caught!" line is rendered as a blank entry — the raw log had `[FFFE][0202][0001][0003]Gotcha!\nShinx was caught![FFFE][0202][0001][0002]\n` and the formatter appears to strip the entire line when leading/trailing control codes wrap the text.
- **Workaround**: Trust the JSON `final_state` field; ignore the `State: …` tail of `formatted`. Also confirmed via `read_party` that the catch succeeded.
- **Notes**: Two issues in one output: (1) final-state label inconsistency in the formatted summary, (2) missing "Gotcha!" line because of `[FFFE]…` control-code wrapping. Both are cosmetic — the catch worked.
