# Pokemon Renegade Platinum QA

You are performing a **QA playthrough** of Pokemon Renegade Platinum using the melonDS MCP tooling. Your primary mission is to play through the game from the start and **document any tool bugs you encounter** along the way.

## QA Mission

**Play the game. Document bugs. Don't fix them.**

- Play normally using the available tools (navigation, battle, inventory, etc.)
- When a tool misbehaves, **immediately save a state and log the bug** in BUG_LOG.md
- Do not edit tool code, analyze memory, write tests, or investigate root causes
- Focus on coverage: exercise as many tools and workflows as possible
- Progress through the story at a reasonable pace - don't rush past areas, but don't over-grind either
- The bug reports you write here will be triaged and fixed in the main RenegadePlatinumPlaytest project

### Bug Reporting Protocol

When you encounter a bug:

1. **Save a state for reproduction** — the save must capture the game state *before* the faulty tool call, so the bug can be reproduced by loading the state and re-running the same call.
   - If the bug is **reproducible from the current state** (e.g., a read tool returning wrong data, a navigate call that always fails from this position), use **`save_state`** with a descriptive name (e.g., `bug_navigate_to_stuck_route203`).
   - If the bug involved a tool that **changed game state** and can't be re-triggered from the current position (e.g., a navigation that moved you partway, a battle turn that advanced the fight), use **`save_checkpoint`** to capture a previous point in time before the tool was called. Name it descriptively.
2. **Add an entry to BUG_LOG.md** with:
   - The tool that failed
   - What you were trying to do
   - What actually happened (include the error/unexpected output)
   - The save state/checkpoint name for reproduction
   - Exact tool call and parameters that triggered it
3. **Work around it** and keep playing - don't get stuck on any single issue
4. If a bug is blocking progress entirely, note it and find an alternative path

### What Counts as a Bug

- Tool returns an error when it shouldn't
- Tool succeeds but produces wrong results (wrong position, wrong items, wrong battle state)
- Tool hangs or times out unexpectedly
- Navigation pathfinding fails on walkable terrain
- Battle automation gets stuck or makes wrong inputs
- UI navigation (menus, bags, PC) ends up in wrong state
- Dialogue advancement misses text or gets stuck
- Any inconsistency between what a read tool reports and what's on screen

### What Is NOT a Bug

- Losing a battle (that's gameplay)
- Game difficulty (that's Renegade Platinum)
- Needing to grind (normal)
- A tool correctly reporting an error (e.g., "not in battle" when you're not in battle)
- One-off manual tasks that no Renegade tool covers (see below)

### Manual / One-Off Tasks

Some game moments — especially early game — involve unique UIs or story sequences that the Renegade tools don't cover (e.g., the professor's intro dialogue, naming your rival, choosing your starter). These are **not bugs or missing features**. They're one-off situations. Use the base melonDS MCP tools (`press_buttons`, `tap_touch_screen`, `advance_frames`, `get_screenshot`, etc.) to get past them manually and move on.

## Getting Started

1. Call `init_emulator` to initialize melonDS.
2. Call `load_rom` with path `/workspace/RenegadePlatinumQA/RenegadePlatinum.nds`.
3. No save states exist yet - you're starting from scratch. Advance through the intro (~8000 frames) to reach the title screen.
4. Save states frequently as you progress. Log them in SAVE_STATES.md.

## Renegade Platinum Story Guide

Renegade Platinum (Drayano's v1.3.0 hack of Pokémon Platinum) relocates NPCs, moves items, adds new story gates, and changes evolutions/types/moves. Use this section as a cheat sheet so you're not blindly wandering when the in-game dialogue doesn't point clearly to the next step. Full source docs were reviewed from `/tmp/Documentation/` (not committed).

### Critical Story Gates (can otherwise trap you)

- **After Eterna Galactic HQ events**: Route 206 is blocked until you talk to the **Bike Shop owner in Eterna City**. Do this before trying to head south.
- **Before Canalave City**: the guard blocks you until you **visit Pal Park** and talk to all the NPCs there to obtain the **Tea** key item. Pal Park is reached via Route 221 once you have Surf + Cut.
- **Valley Windworks door**: Works Key is obtained from Floaroma Meadow (gate at ~(162-163, 641) on Floaroma Town, NOT from Route 205).
- **Route 205 North Galactic Grunts**: permanent blockers until Dawn sends you to Eterna after Windworks/Mars.

### Gift Pokémon (all shiny-eligible; SR to reroll)

- **Twinleaf Town, Mom's house**: Eevee Lv5 (after Lucas/Dawn tells you to talk to Mom).
- **Sandgem Lab**: other two Sinnoh starters Lv5 from Rowan's briefcase (second interaction).
- **Jubilife City**:
  - Trainers' School Cowgirl: random baby-Pokémon Egg.
  - Pokémon Center interviewer: **Bulbasaur / Charmander / Squirtle** Lv5 (win the battle, one per visit).
- **Oreburgh City**:
  - Pokémon Center interviewer: **Treecko / Torchic / Mudkip** Lv10.
  - House near the mine: **Steven gives Beldum** Lv10.
- **Floaroma Town Pokémon Center**: interviewer gives **Chikorita / Cyndaquil / Totodile** Lv15.
- **Eterna City**:
  - Galactic Building (after Jupiter): **Porygon Lv22**.
  - Underground Man's house: **all 7 fossils** (Omanyte/Kabuto/Aerodactyl/Lileep/Anorith/Cranidos/Shieldon) → revive at Oreburgh Museum.
- **Pastoria City**: old lady in a house gives **Lapras Lv35**.

### Evolution Changes (most playthrough-relevant)

- **Eevee stone evolutions** are reassigned: Sun Stone→Espeon, Moon Stone→Umbreon, Leaf Stone→Leafeon, Ice Stone→Glaceon. Water/Fire/Thunder Stones still produce Vaporeon/Flareon/Jolteon. (Already exercised: our Eevee→Vaporeon via Water Stone.)

- Plates/Arceus chain starts at the "Foreign Building" in Hearthome after becoming Champion.

## Save States

See [SAVE_STATES.md](SAVE_STATES.md) for the save state table (starts empty - build it as you go).

## Renegade MCP Tools

Game-specific tools live in the `renegade` MCP server (source: `renegade_mcp/`). Each tool's full schema + usage notes are surfaced via `ToolSearch` and at call time — **don't re-document them here**. Key ROM file indices you'll occasionally want: `0392`=items, `0412`=species, `0610`=abilities, `0647`=moves, `0433`=locations, `0646`=move descriptions.

## Navigation

**CRITICAL: Do not rely on screenshots for spatial reasoning in the overworld.** The isometric/overhead camera makes it very difficult to judge tile positions, room boundaries, and exits from pixel images. Use `view_map` — it returns terrain, player position, NPCs, and **warp destinations with coordinates**, all read live from the emulator. Warp (x,y) tuples can be passed directly to `navigate_to`. Screenshots are fine for dialogue, menus, and battle screens — just not overworld spatial reasoning. When stuck, ask Michael for visual help rather than brute-forcing positions.

## DS Screen Layout

- **Top screen** (256x192): Main game display.
- **Bottom screen** (256x192): Touch-enabled, used for menus, Pokemon selection, etc.
- Screenshots with `screen="both"` show both stacked vertically (256x384).

## Input Reference

**Buttons:** a, b, x, y, l, r, start, select, up, down, left, right

- **A**: Confirm / advance dialogue / interact. Use `press_buttons(["a"], frames=8)`.
- **B**: Cancel / advance dialogue. **Prefer B over A for advancing dialogue** - avoids re-triggering nearby NPCs.
- **X**: Open menu (overworld). **Use X, not Start** - Start does not open the menu in Platinum.
- **D-pad**: Move character / navigate menus.
- **Touch screen**: Tap targets on bottom screen. **Always use `get_screenshot(screen="bottom")`** for coordinate estimation.

### Bag Pocket Tabs (Bottom Screen, in-bag view)
Touch targets arranged in a circle around the Poketch ball:

| Pocket | Tap (x, y) |
|--------|-----------|
| Items | (27, 51) |
| Medicine | (35, 102) |
| Poke Balls | (59, 142) |
| TMs & HMs | (100, 165) |
| Berries | (156, 165) |
| Mail | (195, 142) |
| Battle Items | (220, 102) |
| Key Items | (228, 51) |

### Touch Screen Keyboard (Name Entry)
Letter grid coordinates (calibrated):
- Row 1 (A-J): y=99, x starts at 34, spacing 16px
- Row 2 (K-T): y=118
- Row 3 (U-Z): y=137
- Row 4 (0-9): y=172
- BACK button: x=188, y=74
- OK button: x=222, y=74

## Macros

Saved macros persist across sessions in `macros/`.

| Macro | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `mash_a` | Press A 5 times (8-frame holds, 30-frame waits) for dialogue |
| `mash_b` | Press B 5 times (8-frame holds, 30-frame waits) - safer than A |
| `walk_up` / `walk_down` / `walk_left` / `walk_right` | Walk 2 tiles in the given direction |

## Game Progress

- **Character**: WOJ (boy), rival **Barry**
- **Badges**: 1 (**Coal**)
- **Money**: ~¥12,500 (rough — +$600 Windworks grunt 1 + $560 grunt 2 + $1520 Mars + $480 Hiker Daniel + $512 Aroma Lady + $240 Camper Zackary + $272 Picnicker Siena + $512 Hiker Nicholas + $256 Battle Girl Kelsey + $256 Picnicker Karina + $2400 Cheryl = +$7,608 this session).
- **Location**: **Eterna Forest** (map 203) mid-double-battle with Cheryl as partner. Load `eterna_forest_cheryl_doubles_mid_battle_buneary_paras` to resume mid-battle (vs Bug Catcher Jack's Paras Lv16 + Lass's Buneary Lv17 at 30/47 HP; Monferno 85/85, Chansey 76/136). **Cleaner restart: `eterna_forest_entered_south`** — just entered forest at (29,86), Cheryl still at (28,83) ready to be talked to. Also saved: `windworks_door_pre_unlock_works_key` (pre-Works-Key-prompt), `windworks_pre_mars_monferno_lv26` (pre-Mars battle), `bug008_cheryl_trainer_01e0_01e1_codes` (BUG-009 repro — mid-Cheryl-battle).
- **Party** (all full HP from Cheryl's partner-heal after defeating her):
  1. **Monferno** Lv28 (Quirky, Blaze) — Low Kick (PP 20/20) / **Flamethrower (PP 14/15, NEW this session, replaced Flame Wheel)** / Fake Out (PP 10/10) / Rock Smash (PP 15/15). 85/85 HP.
  2. **Vaporeon** Lv16 (Serious, Water Absorb) — Water Pulse / Quick Attack / Bite / Covet. 72/72 HP. (Still un-leveled — EXP Share on Burmy, not rotated.)
  3. **Burmy** Lv19 (Naive, Shed Skin), **holding Exp. Share** — Protect / Tackle / Bug Bite / Hidden Power. 47/47 HP. (+6 levels this session from heavy trainer traffic.)
  4. **Shinx** Lv6 (Timid, Guts) — Tackle / Leer / Howl / Quick Attack. 21/21 HP. (Still un-leveled. Not usable in current dungeon — switch or box.)
- **Key Items**: Bicycle, Poké Radar, Journal, Vs. Recorder, Town Map, Pokétch (all apps), Fashion Case, HM06 Rock Smash (on Monferno), Coal Badge, Works Key. No new key items this session.
- **Bag** (new additions this session in bold):
  - Medicine: prior stock **+ 1 Super Potion** (Route 205 N (219,608) Pokeball), **+ 1 Antidote** (Eterna Forest (15,81) Pokeball).
  - Poké Balls: ~21 (unchanged).
  - Items: prior stock **+ Destiny Knot** (Route 205 N (204,603) Pokeball), **+ Repel** (Route 205 N (203,603) Pokeball).
  - TMs & HMs: unchanged.
- **Story flags** (new this session in bold):
  - All priors still valid.
  - **Unlocked Valley Windworks door** with Works Key — `interact_with(243, 654)` triggered Yes/No prompt, confirmed, "Ker-chunk! The door to Valley Windworks opened!"
  - **Cleared Valley Windworks interior (map 201)**: ran-off-grunt at (12,14) (no battle, flavor only), then Grunt M trainer_id=298 at (3,8) (Grimer Lv15 / Koffing Lv15) and Grunt M trainer_id=299 at (12,3) (Kakuna Lv14 / Pineco Lv14 / Metapod Lv14).
  - **Defeated Commander Mars** — Zubat Lv18 / Bronzor Lv18 (Sitrus Berry, Levitate) / Yanma Lv18 (Speed Boost, Detect) / Purugly Lv19 (Thick Fat, Fake Out, Hypnosis, Sitrus Berry). Yanma's Air Cutter would 4x SE Monferno — lucky miss. Purugly flinched Monferno once via Fake Out, then Hypnosis missed twice. Full Charon/Papa/daughter post-battle cutscene played out. Papa mentions "I think the balloon Pokémon will come visiting again!" — foreshadows Drifloon.
  - **Met Looker again** — he's at Valley Windworks exterior (242,659) after Mars's defeat, tells WOJ "Team Galactic hideout is in Eterna City."
  - **Confirmed Route 205 N Galactic Grunts cleared after Mars** — went north through Route 205 N, no blockade, path clear to Eterna Forest.
  - **Defeated all Route 205 N trainers**: Hiker Daniel (Diglett / Numel / Shieldon), Aroma Lady Elizabeth (Chikorita / Bulbasaur — note "Pokemon Breeder F" display name maps to "Aroma Lady" in-battle), Camper Zackary (Aipom / Taillow / Slakoth — **Monferno leveled up to 27 and learned Flamethrower after Aipom KO — forgot Flame Wheel**), Picnicker Siena (Pachirisu), Hiker Nicholas (Shellos / Onix), Battle Girl Kelsey (Machop / Meditite / Mankey), Picnicker Karina (Piplup / Chimchar).
  - **Entered Eterna Forest (map 203)** via Route 205 N warps at (206-207, 581).
  - **Defeated Cheryl as solo test-trainer** (Drifloon Lv19 / Wailmer Lv19 / Makuhita Lv19 Thick Fat / Chansey Lv20 with Hyper Voice/Ice Beam/Thunderbolt/Soft-Boiled) — **Monferno leveled up to 28 on Makuhita KO**. Cheryl joined as partner, auto-heals party between battles.
  - **Currently mid-double-battle** — vs Bug Catcher Jack (Surskit Lv16 KO'd, Paras Lv16 at full) + Lass (Buneary Lv17 at 30/47, still has Jump Kick). Cheryl's Chansey at 76/136 HP (tanked a Jump Kick). Next `battle_turn` needed.
- **Next session start**:
  1. Load `eterna_forest_cheryl_doubles_mid_battle_buneary_paras` to resume the doubles, OR load `eterna_forest_entered_south` for a cleaner start and re-trigger Cheryl via `interact_with(object_index=1)`.
  2. Finish Bug Catcher + Lass double battle — suggest Flamethrower target=1 on Buneary (Normal 1x × Fire 1x = neutral, STAB 135 pwr vs 22 Def should OHKO 30-HP Buneary); or Rock Smash on Buneary for 2x SE (safer OHKO). Chansey can handle Paras via Ice Beam (1x) or Thunderbolt (2x Ground-immune... wait Paras is Bug/Grass, Thunderbolt = 1x × 1x = 1x).
  3. Clear rest of Eterna Forest (map 203) — exit north to Route 211 / Mt. Coronet connector or directly to Eterna City (map 429 likely).
  4. Once in Eterna City: Gardenia's gym (TM86 Grass Knot), talk to Bike Shop owner to re-open Route 206 (RP-specific gate), pick up Porygon after Jupiter, grab HM01 Cut from Cynthia.
  5. **Shinx still at Lv6** — consider depositing (Box 1 has only Shinx currently? check) since it's not surviving anywhere. Or dedicated grind session post-Cheryl when no partner restriction.
  6. Moss Rock confirmed at (17, 66) in Eterna Forest — RP reassigns Eevee evolutions so this doesn't proc Leafeon anymore (Leaf Stone → Leafeon in RP). Informational only, we're already a Vaporeon.
- **Open QA bugs after this session**:
  - **BUG-007** still open (post-battle token elision on Roark-class reward dialogue). Not re-triggered this session — no similar reward cutscene fired.
  - **BUG-008** **VERIFIED FIXED (2026-04-17 session 8)** — 4 clean item pickups this session (Destiny Knot, Repel, Super Potion, Antidote), all parse cleanly with no hex-code leaks. Fix scope verified.
  - **BUG-009 NEW (this session)** — `[01E0][01E1] Trainer Cheryl` prefix leak on trainer battle macro lines ("is about to send in X", "sent out X", "used one X", "Player defeated X"). Different code family from BUG-008, different text context (trainer class prefix vs pocket icon). Cheryl's base name + all her chat dialogue parse clean — only the scripted battle macro lines leak. See BUG_LOG.md.
  - **Possible BUG-004 echo** (carried forward from session 7, still unverified).
- **FR docket**: FR-003, FR-004, FR-005 still open. No new FRs filed this session. FR-005 applied without confusion again (target=0 / target=1 for Cheryl doubles).
- **Session 8 highlights**:
  - Monferno's Flame Wheel → Flamethrower upgrade at Lv27 is a big power jump (75 → 95 BP, Special with higher SpA vs Atk on Monferno is roughly similar, but Flamethrower's 100% accuracy and lack of contact is clean).
  - Mars's team was harder than expected — Yanma with Speed Boost + Detect is a tool gym. Detect wasted a precious Flame Wheel PP.
  - Cheryl as partner auto-heals — no need to heal between forest double battles. Nice quality-of-life.
  - Drifloon as Cheryl's ace (replacing Mothim in vanilla) ties back to the Windworks papa/daughter cutscene's "balloon Pokémon" line — nice RP touch, confirmed.
  - `interact_with` on objects with `flee_encounters=True` worked reliably for walking around trainers' sight lines and auto-fleeing the wild Buneary encounters on Route 205 N. Clean exercise of that parameter.
  - **Wrong-building warp confusion**: warp at (214, 594) on Route 205 with dest="Route 205" actually enters a house (map 348) — not the Eterna Forest gate as I initially assumed. The real Eterna Forest entrance is further north at (206-207, 581). Worth noting for future routing.

## Tips

- Save state frequently - this is a difficulty hack, expect challenges.
- **Use `read_battle` at the start of every battle** - Renegade Platinum changes abilities and movesets from vanilla.
- **`read_dialogue` auto-advances by default** - just call it after triggering dialogue and it handles everything. Only need manual intervention for Yes/No and multi-choice prompts.
- The `load_state` tool may occasionally hang - check `get_status` to verify.
- Addresses must be passed as decimal integers to MCP tools, not hex strings.
- **Touch screen taps default to `frames=8`** - changed from 1 to avoid missed inputs.
- **Wait 300 frames between UI navigation steps** - Pokemon ignores input during forced text delays.
- **Always check the bottom screen for Yes/No prompts** - battle/switch prompts use touch screen.
- **Pause menu remembers cursor position** - cursor index stored at `0x0229FA28`. The `use_item` tool reads this automatically.
- **Trainer battles may have multiple Pokemon** - handle "Will you switch?" prompt before next action.
- **Evolution is handled** - `battle_turn` and `auto_grind` detect "is evolving" text and handle it automatically.
- **Use free switches at SWITCH_PROMPT** - don't tunnel-vision on one Pokemon.
- **Never mash A/B in battle or prompts** - single presses only to avoid skipping past important states.
