# Pokemon Renegade Platinum QA

You are performing a **QA playthrough** of Pokemon Renegade Platinum using the melonDS MCP tooling. Your primary mission is to play through the game from the start and **document any tool bugs you encounter** along the way.

## QA Mission

**Play the game. Document bugs. Don't fix them.**

- Play normally using the available tools (navigation, battle, inventory, etc.)
- When a tool misbehaves, **immediately save a state and log the bug** in BUG_LOG.md
- Do not edit tool code, analyze memory, write tests, or investigate root causes
- Focus on coverage: exercise as many tools and workflows as possible
- Progress through the story at a reasonable pace - don't rush past areas, but don't over-grind either
- The bug reports you write here will be triaged and fixed in the main RenegadePlatinumPlaytest project

### Bug Reporting Protocol

When you encounter a bug:

1. **Save a state for reproduction** — the save must capture the game state *before* the faulty tool call, so the bug can be reproduced by loading the state and re-running the same call.
   - If the bug is **reproducible from the current state** (e.g., a read tool returning wrong data, a navigate call that always fails from this position), use **`save_state`** with a descriptive name (e.g., `bug_navigate_to_stuck_route203`).
   - If the bug involved a tool that **changed game state** and can't be re-triggered from the current position (e.g., a navigation that moved you partway, a battle turn that advanced the fight), use **`save_checkpoint`** to capture a previous point in time before the tool was called. Name it descriptively.
2. **Add an entry to BUG_LOG.md** with:
   - The tool that failed
   - What you were trying to do
   - What actually happened (include the error/unexpected output)
   - The save state/checkpoint name for reproduction
   - Exact tool call and parameters that triggered it
3. **Work around it** and keep playing - don't get stuck on any single issue
4. If a bug is blocking progress entirely, note it and find an alternative path

### What Counts as a Bug

- Tool returns an error when it shouldn't
- Tool succeeds but produces wrong results (wrong position, wrong items, wrong battle state)
- Tool hangs or times out unexpectedly
- Navigation pathfinding fails on walkable terrain
- Battle automation gets stuck or makes wrong inputs
- UI navigation (menus, bags, PC) ends up in wrong state
- Dialogue advancement misses text or gets stuck
- Any inconsistency between what a read tool reports and what's on screen

### What Is NOT a Bug

- Losing a battle (that's gameplay)
- Game difficulty (that's Renegade Platinum)
- Needing to grind (normal)
- A tool correctly reporting an error (e.g., "not in battle" when you're not in battle)
- One-off manual tasks that no Renegade tool covers (see below)

### Manual / One-Off Tasks

Some game moments — especially early game — involve unique UIs or story sequences that the Renegade tools don't cover (e.g., the professor's intro dialogue, naming your rival, choosing your starter). These are **not bugs or missing features**. They're one-off situations. Use the base melonDS MCP tools (`press_buttons`, `tap_touch_screen`, `advance_frames`, `get_screenshot`, etc.) to get past them manually and move on.

## Getting Started

1. Call `init_emulator` to initialize melonDS.
2. Call `load_rom` with path `/workspace/RenegadePlatinumQA/RenegadePlatinum.nds`.
3. No save states exist yet - you're starting from scratch. Advance through the intro (~8000 frames) to reach the title screen.
4. Save states frequently as you progress. Log them in SAVE_STATES.md.

## Renegade Platinum Story Guide

Renegade Platinum (Drayano's v1.3.0 hack of Pokémon Platinum) relocates NPCs, moves items, adds new story gates, and changes evolutions/types/moves. Use this section as a cheat sheet so you're not blindly wandering when the in-game dialogue doesn't point clearly to the next step. Full source docs were reviewed from `/tmp/Documentation/` (not committed).

### Critical Story Gates (can otherwise trap you)

- **After Eterna Galactic HQ events**: Route 206 is blocked until you talk to the **Bike Shop owner in Eterna City**. Do this before trying to head south.
- **Before Canalave City**: the guard blocks you until you **visit Pal Park** and talk to all the NPCs there to obtain the **Tea** key item. Pal Park is reached via Route 221 once you have Surf + Cut.
- **Valley Windworks door**: Works Key is obtained from Floaroma Meadow (gate at ~(162-163, 641) on Floaroma Town, NOT from Route 205).
- **Route 205 North Galactic Grunts**: permanent blockers until Dawn sends you to Eterna after Windworks/Mars.

### Gift Pokémon (all shiny-eligible; SR to reroll)

- **Twinleaf Town, Mom's house**: Eevee Lv5 (after Lucas/Dawn tells you to talk to Mom).
- **Sandgem Lab**: other two Sinnoh starters Lv5 from Rowan's briefcase (second interaction).
- **Jubilife City**:
  - Trainers' School Cowgirl: random baby-Pokémon Egg.
  - Pokémon Center interviewer: **Bulbasaur / Charmander / Squirtle** Lv5 (win the battle, one per visit).
- **Oreburgh City**:
  - Pokémon Center interviewer: **Treecko / Torchic / Mudkip** Lv10.
  - House near the mine: **Steven gives Beldum** Lv10.
- **Floaroma Town Pokémon Center**: interviewer gives **Chikorita / Cyndaquil / Totodile** Lv15.
- **Eterna City**:
  - Galactic Building (after Jupiter): **Porygon Lv22**.
  - Underground Man's house: **all 7 fossils** (Omanyte/Kabuto/Aerodactyl/Lileep/Anorith/Cranidos/Shieldon) → revive at Oreburgh Museum.
- **Pastoria City**: old lady in a house gives **Lapras Lv35**.

## Save States

See [SAVE_STATES.md](SAVE_STATES.md) for the save state table (starts empty - build it as you go).

## Renegade MCP Tools

Game-specific tools live in the `renegade` MCP server (source: `renegade_mcp/`). Each tool's full schema + usage notes are surfaced via `ToolSearch` and at call time — **don't re-document them here**. Key ROM file indices you'll occasionally want: `0392`=items, `0412`=species, `0610`=abilities, `0647`=moves, `0433`=locations, `0646`=move descriptions.

## Navigation

**CRITICAL: Do not rely on screenshots for spatial reasoning in the overworld.** The isometric/overhead camera makes it very difficult to judge tile positions, room boundaries, and exits from pixel images. Use `view_map` — it returns terrain, player position, NPCs, and **warp destinations with coordinates**, all read live from the emulator. Warp (x,y) tuples can be passed directly to `navigate_to`. Screenshots are fine for dialogue, menus, and battle screens — just not overworld spatial reasoning. When stuck, ask Michael for visual help rather than brute-forcing positions.

## DS Screen Layout

- **Top screen** (256x192): Main game display.
- **Bottom screen** (256x192): Touch-enabled, used for menus, Pokemon selection, etc.
- Screenshots with `screen="both"` show both stacked vertically (256x384).

## Input Reference

**Buttons:** a, b, x, y, l, r, start, select, up, down, left, right

- **A**: Confirm / advance dialogue / interact. Use `press_buttons(["a"], frames=8)`.
- **B**: Cancel / advance dialogue. **Prefer B over A for advancing dialogue** - avoids re-triggering nearby NPCs.
- **X**: Open menu (overworld). **Use X, not Start** - Start does not open the menu in Platinum.
- **D-pad**: Move character / navigate menus.
- **Touch screen**: Tap targets on bottom screen. **Always use `get_screenshot(screen="bottom")`** for coordinate estimation.

### Bag Pocket Tabs (Bottom Screen, in-bag view)
Touch targets arranged in a circle around the Poketch ball:

| Pocket | Tap (x, y) |
|--------|-----------|
| Items | (27, 51) |
| Medicine | (35, 102) |
| Poke Balls | (59, 142) |
| TMs & HMs | (100, 165) |
| Berries | (156, 165) |
| Mail | (195, 142) |
| Battle Items | (220, 102) |
| Key Items | (228, 51) |

### Touch Screen Keyboard (Name Entry)
Letter grid coordinates (calibrated):
- Row 1 (A-J): y=99, x starts at 34, spacing 16px
- Row 2 (K-T): y=118
- Row 3 (U-Z): y=137
- Row 4 (0-9): y=172
- BACK button: x=188, y=74
- OK button: x=222, y=74

## Macros

Saved macros persist across sessions in `macros/`.

| Macro | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `mash_a` | Press A 5 times (8-frame holds, 30-frame waits) for dialogue |
| `mash_b` | Press B 5 times (8-frame holds, 30-frame waits) - safer than A |
| `walk_up` / `walk_down` / `walk_left` / `walk_right` | Walk 2 tiles in the given direction |

## Game Progress

- **Character**: WOJ (boy), rival **Barry**
- **Badges**: 1 (**Coal**)
- **Money**: ¥4,260 (after 5 Super Potions @ ¥700 each in Floaroma Mart).
- **Location**: Inside **Floaroma Mart** (map 427) at (3,7). Load `floaroma_mart_post_buy_super_potions`. Full-HP-healed backup: `floaroma_pc_healed_post_route204_trainers`.
- **Party**:
  1. **Monferno** Lv25 (Quirky, Blaze) — Low Kick / Flame Wheel / **Fake Out** (learned Lv23, replaced Ember) / Rock Smash. 76/76 HP.
  2. **Vaporeon** Lv16 (Serious, **Water Absorb**) — **Water Pulse** (learned Lv16 — RP gave Water Pulse instead of vanilla's Water Gun!) / Quick Attack / Bite / Covet. 72/72 HP. Skipped Haze at Lv14.
  3. **Burmy** Lv10 (Naive, Shed Skin), **holding Exp. Share** — Protect / Tackle / Bug Bite / Hidden Power. 29/29 HP.
  4. **Shinx** Lv6 (Timid, Guts) — Tackle / Leer / Howl / Quick Attack. 21/21 HP.
- **Key Items**: Bicycle, Poké Radar, Journal, Vs. Recorder, Town Map, Pokétch (all apps), **Fashion Case** (from Jubilife TV reporter post-Galactic-battle), **HM06 Rock Smash** (on Monferno), **Coal Badge**.
- **Bag**: **5 Super Potions**, 9 Repels, 21 Poké Balls, **Exp. Share (on Burmy)**, **Silk Scarf**, **Oval Stone**, **Expert Belt** (Ravaged Path), **Miracle Seed** (Route 204N), TM39 Rock Tomb, TM58 Endure x99, TM76 Stealth Rock x99, HM06 Rock Smash.
- **Story flags**:
  - All priors, plus this session: **Jubilife Team Galactic cutscene done** (Dawn partnered, beat 2 Grunts: Stunky Lv13+Glameow Lv13, Cascoon+Silcoon sent in; won, got Fashion Case from Jubilife TV reporter).
  - **Barry cutscene on Oreburgh exit** — no battle; he's off to Jubilife chasing the Eterna Badge.
  - **Route 204 S trainers defeated**: Lass Sarah, Youngster Tyler (Magikarp dad), Lass Samantha.
  - **Ravaged Path cleared** (entry → exit only; no HM-gated expansion, needs Surf for the water path). Items: Expert Belt, TM39 Rock Tomb.
  - **Route 204 N trainers defeated**: Aroma Lady Taylor, Bug Catcher Brandon, Twins Liv & Liz (double battle). Items picked up: Miracle Seed.
  - **Not yet fought**: Ace Trainer F on Route 204 N at (191,676) — skipped to heal first.
  - Arrived in **Floaroma Town**, healed at PC, bought 5 Super Potions.
- **Next session start**:
  1. Load `floaroma_mart_post_buy_super_potions`. Exit mart south to Floaroma Town overworld.
  2. Optional backtrack: fight Ace Trainer F on Route 204N (191,676) for XP — reachable via south exit of Floaroma.
  3. Story path: Floaroma Meadow cutscene (Team Galactic grunts stealing Honey) → **Valley Windworks** (next gym progression beat — Commander Mars). Meadow is east of Floaroma; Windworks is further west. Check `view_map` from Floaroma overworld for the warps.
  4. Grind Shinx (Lv6, falling behind) when convenient — Exp Share is currently on Burmy (Lv10), could rotate to Shinx.
- **Open QA bugs after this session**:
  - **BUG-007** (post-battle reward dialogue elides `{ITEM}`/`{POCKET}`/`{ARTICLE}` tokens to empty strings). Still open from last session.
  - **BUG-008 (NEW)**: Hex text-format codes leak through dialogue output — `[0113]` / `[0114]` / `[0115]` for pocket-name color codes, `[01C2]` for `&`, `[01D2]` for `%`, `[0120]` for `&` in trainer-name joins. Distinct code family from BUG-005's `[VAR]…` form, which was marked FIXED but its same-family siblings from the BUG-005 examples list (`[25BD]`, `[01A8]`, `[FFFE]`) likely still leak along this same path. Repro on any item pickup (`interact_with` Pokeball) or post-battle reward cutscene. Saves: `jubilife_galactic_grunts_double_battle_start`, `post_galactic_grunts_jubilife_fashion_case`.
- **FR docket** (unchanged this session): FR-003, FR-004, FR-005 still open. No new FRs filed this session — FR-003 correctly primed me to reach for `use_battle_item` context (wasn't needed, no in-battle items used this session); FR-004 similarly unused (no stone evos); FR-005 unused (no mid-battle switches).
- **Session 6 highlights**: `auto_grind` with new **`auto_heal=True`** cross-map mode performed flawlessly — 5 cross-map heal trips (grass → Jubilife PC → back to Route 204 grass) across one ~70-battle grind. That was previously blocked by BUG-002 and the coordinate-based auto-heal API; the new auto_heal parameter bypasses both. Also exercised `give_item`, `take_item` (both clean), and `use_medicine` with `priority` override (clean). Did NOT exercise HM obstacle (no Cut tree or Rock Smash rock in the path to Floaroma).

## Tips

- Save state frequently - this is a difficulty hack, expect challenges.
- **Use `read_battle` at the start of every battle** - Renegade Platinum changes abilities and movesets from vanilla.
- **`read_dialogue` auto-advances by default** - just call it after triggering dialogue and it handles everything. Only need manual intervention for Yes/No and multi-choice prompts.
- The `load_state` tool may occasionally hang - check `get_status` to verify.
- Addresses must be passed as decimal integers to MCP tools, not hex strings.
- **Touch screen taps default to `frames=8`** - changed from 1 to avoid missed inputs.
- **Wait 300 frames between UI navigation steps** - Pokemon ignores input during forced text delays.
- **Always check the bottom screen for Yes/No prompts** - battle/switch prompts use touch screen.
- **Pause menu remembers cursor position** - cursor index stored at `0x0229FA28`. The `use_item` tool reads this automatically.
- **Trainer battles may have multiple Pokemon** - handle "Will you switch?" prompt before next action.
- **Evolution is handled** - `battle_turn` and `auto_grind` detect "is evolving" text and handle it automatically.
- **Use free switches at SWITCH_PROMPT** - don't tunnel-vision on one Pokemon.
- **Never mash A/B in battle or prompts** - single presses only to avoid skipping past important states.
